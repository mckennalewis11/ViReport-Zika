<h2>Input Dataset</h2>
<p>
The analysis was conducted on a dataset containing 683 sequences. The average sequence length was 10644.0732, with a standard deviation of 170.0638. The earliest sample date was 1947-01-01, the median sample date was 2016-05-29, and the most recent sample date was 2019-07-02.

<h2>Preprocessed Dataset</h2>
<p>
The input dataset was preprocessed such that sequences were given safe names: non-letters/digits in sequence IDs were converted to underscores. After preprocessing, the dataset contained 683 sequences. The average sequence length was 10644.0732, with a standard deviation of 170.0638. The earliest sample date was 1947-01-01, the median sample date was 2016-05-29, and the most recent sample date was 2019-07-02.

<h2>Multiple Sequence Alignment</h2>
<p>
Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT (Katoh & Standley, 2013) in automatic mode. There were 11585 positions (932 invariant) and 628 unique sequences in the multiple sequence alignment. Pairwise distances were computed from the multiple sequence alignment using the tn93 tool of HIV-TRACE (Pond et al., 2018). The average pairwise sequence distance was 0.0126, with a standard deviation of 0.0266.

<p>
Across the positions of the multiple sequence alignment, the minimum coverage was 0, the maximum coverage was 0.999, and the average coverage was 0.894, with a standard deviation of 0.251.

<p>
 Across the positions of the multiple sequence alignment that had non-zero Shannon entropy, the minimum Shannon entropy was 0.0159, the maximum Shannon entropy was 1.585, and the average Shannon entropy was 0.122, with a standard deviation of 0.161.

A significance threshold was computed using Tukey's Rule: 1.5x the interquartile range added to the third quartile, which was 0.0423. The significance threshold is shown as a red dashed line, and significant points are shown in red.</figcaption>

<h2>Phylogenetic Inference</h2>
<p>
A maximum-likelihood phylogeny was inferred using IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al., 2015) in ModelFinder Plus mode (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017). The inferred phylogeny was MinVar-rooted using FastRoot (Mai et al., 2017). The tree was too large to draw.Pairwise distances were computed from the phylogeny using TreeSwift (Moshiri, 2020). The maximum pairwise phylogenetic distance (i.e., tree diameter) was 0.196, and the average pairwise phylogenetic distance was 0.0164, with a standard deviation of 0.0388.
